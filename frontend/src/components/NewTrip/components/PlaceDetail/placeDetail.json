The food, service and the atmosphere of the place were all very bad and everything is overpriced!!\n\nWe were seated and the server came to take the order. That was the only time someone came to the table. We ordered a portion of paneer chilli dry, manhurian balls with sauce and Hakka vegetarian chow mein.\n\nTo start of with the food is off very poor standard, paneer chilli had a burnt taste, hakka chow mein were dripping in oil and the manchurian balls were just kept in plate and topped off with sauce.\n\nThey served the Hakka noodles and manchurian sauce was  served after about 15mins and asking twice for it.\n\nLastly, we just sat there looking around the place for about 15 20 mins, hoping someone would stop by to ask how the food was and we could request for the check. Finally I had to walk up to the desk and ask for the check which they have after another 10mins. Never going back and would not recommend to anyone!",

      "text": "We decided to try Chili Pepper House for dinner because we wanted to try Asian Indian fused food. So we were expecting dishes packed with flavor from the spices. Place  was clean and service a bit slow. But the staff was very friendly.\n\nWe ordered the Veggie Pakora and Chutney Sauce. It was delicious. We also ordered the butter chicken. The sauce was red and tasted no way near what butter chicken should taste like. My sons, who love butter chicken didn't finish their plate. We also ordered  Curry Fish and Curry Egg Plant. The Curry was disappointing. There was no spices no flavor. The Curry was definitely not Indian and not Chinese either. It was just bland. Don't recommend the Curry Dishes.\n\nWe also ordered the Seafood Fried Rice which was good. Because my sons were hungry still I also ordered Beef Tomato with Egg. Dish was good. If they added some sugar to offset the sour taste from the tomatoes, dish would have been very good.\n\nThe food definitely tasted different from the last time we ate here which was over 5 plus years ago. Food than had lots of flavourful and spices.\n\nMaybe there other dishes that others commented about are worth the visit. If we do come back (we like to support local eateries) we'll stay away from the curry dishes.",
